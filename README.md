# World-of-Color
A platformer made in python.  There are seperate levels and the player must make it through all the levels with their fixed number of lives to make it to the color wheel at the end of the game.

## Instructions
To play the game run main.py from a terminal or command prompt and a window will appear.
The game is fairly self-explanatory. Use the arrow keys to move, avoid the spikes and the gaps in the floor and get to the doorways for the next level.
